Idk what's stopping the kdramas from doing it? Welcome to Samdalri they had 35+ year old actors to wear high school uniforms. Moving was the worst cause when I saw Cha Tae Hyun as a high schooler I couldn't stop laughing. I know these actors were crying inside being embarrassed,89

**Discussion Format**

This post is composed of two discussion sections:

**Episodic discussion:** Individual episode threads for the discussion of the individual episodes so users are able to watch and discuss at their own pace while avoiding spoilers. Within these discussion threads, you **must not include any discussion or spoilers** for episodes after the episode in question. Spoiler tags should be used for major plot spoilers within the episode. Individual episode discussion threads may be accessed through the links in this comment to prevent users seeing whole series spoilers. To participate in these threads reply to the comment ""Episode ..."" or another user's comment. Please report any comments that spoil later episodes using the custom report ""user has spoiled a later episode"" rather than the general ""unhidden spoiler"" report.

**Whole series discussion:** General discussion of the series may be made as a direct reply to the post or a reply to another user's comment outside of the individual discussion threads. Please use spoiler tags for any spoilers within these comments. 

If discussing source material please mark spoilers accordingly e.g. (webtoon spoiler) >!webtoon spoilers go here!<.
