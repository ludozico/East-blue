"Breaking: Lee Sun Gyun Passes Away, Police Confirms",https://www.soompi.com/article/1633688wpp/breaking-lee-sun-gyun-passes-away-police-confirms,1197,"This really breaks my heart. He was my favorite Korean actor—and not just among the *ahjussi*s or the veterans. He was such a ""giving"" or generous actor. I always thought he had this magic to elevate his co-stars' performances on screen, even through the subtlest of ways. What was even cooler to me is that he could have such a distinctive walk, voice, fashion sense (the same scarves!) in many of his dramas yet manage to fool me into believing these are all wildly different characters. Different from his variety show persona too.

He also sure knew how to pick a good script. His choices were not always safe, but somehow always interesting.

The last few months were rough for me as a fan but disappointment notwithstanding, I never expected this to happen. It was only yesterday that I thought the only way for him to get his career back was to accept one of his Hollywood offers and start there... but now that's not even a possibility anymore.

I hope Jeon Hye-jin and his two sons are doing okay. All the people who worked with him (especially multiple times) too. I will miss seeing this guy on screen. RIP",1

"JTBC 'Doctor Slump' Teaser Poster [Park Shin Hye, Park Hyung Sik; Premieres January 27]",https://i.redd.it/nb8c7whb757c1.jpeg,474,One thing I loved about The Worst of Evil was the actors who played the younger counterparts were accurately cast. Idk what's stopping the kdramas from doing it? Welcome to Samdalri they had 35+ year old actors to wear high school uniforms. Moving was the worst cause when I saw Cha Tae Hyun as a high schooler I couldn't stop laughing. I know these actors were crying inside being embarrassed,89
